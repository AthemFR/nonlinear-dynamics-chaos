    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to produce a professionally-structured Python notebook (including well-documented functions/cells, clearly labelled figures (axes, units, legends, etc), where you carry out the following activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Derivation and setup:** write down the governing equations, define all variables and parameters, nondimensionalize if appropriate, and identify parameter(s) to vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local analysis:** find fixed point(s), compute the Jacobian, classify linear stability (eigenvalues), and state conditions for any local bifurcations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global / numerical analysis:** use Scipy or your own integrators to perform numerical integration and produce phase portraits, nullclines, and trajectories showing typical behaviors (stable/unstable nodes, spirals, limit cycles, saddles).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bifurcation study:** produce one or more bifurcation diagrams (parameter sweep) that reveal creation/destruction of fixed points or limit cycles. Include sketches or annotated plots showing how the phase portrait changes across bifurcation values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Solution representation / interpretation:** make some plots of each variable $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ or $\\theta(t)$ and $\\omega(t)$ versus time $t$ and provide a short and clear interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission and Oral Presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be required to present your notebook and results **in a short and concise 5-minute presentation on Sunday 30 November 2025**. Please submit your notebook prior to your presentation using the link provided via email."
