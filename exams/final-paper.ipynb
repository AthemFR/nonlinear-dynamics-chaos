    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each student must submit a **short scientific paper (maximum 5 pages including references)** based on the 3D dynamical-systems project. You must use the **IOP LaTeX template** provided here: https://cms.iopscience.iop.org/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/a83f1ab6-cd8f-11e0-be51-5d01ae4695ed/LaTeXTemplates.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please write the text yourself and use your own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your paper must follow the structure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "A concise summary (max. 150 words) of the system studied, the main analytical and numerical methods, and the key findings about chaotic vs. non-chaotic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Briefly motivate the dynamical system you selected (Rössler, Chen, or Sprott).  \n",
    "- Explain its **relevance in physics**, e.g. nonlinear dynamics, turbulence modelling, chemical oscillations, electrical circuits, or other physical contexts.  \n",
    "- State the **objectives** of the project:  \n",
    "  - analyse the system analytically (fixed points, stability, bifurcations),  \n",
    "  - study the transition to chaos,  \n",
    "  - implement a numerical solver,  \n",
    "  - explore trajectories and diagnostics such as Lyapunov divergence, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Analytical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This section must include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volume contraction analysis** (if applicable) to discuss dissipativity.  \n",
    "- **Derivation of fixed points**.  \n",
    "- **Linear stability analysis**:  \n",
    "  - Compute the Jacobian,  \n",
    "  - evaluate eigenvalues at fixed points.  \n",
    "- **Identification of bifurcation parameters** and discussion of how chaotic behaviour emerges in the chosen model (supported by references).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Numerical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly but clearly describe the implementation choices made in your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- your **Python class design** (show a workflow diagram),  \n",
    "- the **ODE slope function**,  \n",
    "- the **two integrators** (your custom RK scheme and the SciPy method),  \n",
    "- the **divergence metric / Lyapunov estimate**,  \n",
    "- the **VTP output** for ParaView/VisIt,  \n",
    "- your **parameter-scan strategy** (e.g. for bifurcations or chaos detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Present and discuss your main numerical findings (use your code to make figures and generate outputs for fancy VisIt or Paraview renderings):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-chaotic vs. chaotic trajectories**,  \n",
    "- **3D phase-space plots** and phase portraits,  \n",
    "- **Time series** \\(x(t), y(t), z(t)\\),  \n",
    "- **Divergence of nearby trajectories** and your estimate of the Lyapunov exponent,  \n",
    "- **Bifurcation diagram** for the key control parameter,  \n",
    "- **Poincaré map** using an appropriate section.\n",
    "\n",
    "All figures must be clearly labelled and physically interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarise the main insights, addressing the objectives stated in the Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the analytical structure of the system,  \n",
    "- what triggers chaotic behaviour,  \n",
    "- how your numerical solver performed,  \n",
    "- what the simulations reveal about nonlinear dynamics in the chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep conclusions short and to the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "\n",
    "Include all papers, books, and online material used (including the references provided in the assignment). Use a standard bibliography style.\n"
