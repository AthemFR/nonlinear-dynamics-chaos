    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each student must submit a **short scientific paper (maximum 5 pages including references)** based on the 3D dynamical-systems project. You must use the **IOP LaTeX template** provided here: https://cms.iopscience.iop.org/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/a83f1ab6-cd8f-11e0-be51-5d01ae4695ed/LaTeXTemplates.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Please write the text yourself and use your own words. Copying and pasting text from AI is not permitted.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your paper must follow the structure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "A concise summary (max. 150 words) of the system studied, the main analytical and numerical methods, and the key findings about chaotic vs. non-chaotic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Briefly motivate the dynamical system you selected (Rössler, Chen, or Sprott).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write down the governing equations, define all variables and parameters, and identify parameter(s) to vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain its **relevance in physics**, e.g. nonlinear dynamics, turbulence modelling, chemical oscillations, electrical circuits, or other physical contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- State the **objectives** of the project:  \n",
    "  - analyse the system analytically (fixed points, stability, bifurcations),\n",
    "  - implement a numerical solver,  \n",
    "  - numerically study the transition to chaos,  \n",
    "  - explore trajectories and diagnostics with the simulations outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Analytical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This section should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Derivation of fixed points\n",
    "- Linear stability analysis\n",
    "- Bifurcation diagram for the key control parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Numerical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show your **Python class design using a workflow diagram** (use your preferred tool), which summarises the class methods that you implemented in your code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, briefly but clearly describe the implementation in your code of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the **ODE slope function**,\n",
    "    - the **two integrators** (your custom RK scheme and the SciPy method),  \n",
    "    - the **divergence metric / Lyapunov estimate**,  \n",
    "    - the **VTP output** for ParaView/VisIt,  \n",
    "    - your **parameter-scan strategy** (e.g. for bifurcations, chaos detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Present and discuss your main numerical findings (use your code to make figures and generate outputs for fancy VisIt or Paraview renderings):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-chaotic vs. chaotic trajectories**,  \n",
    "- **Time series** of $x(t), y(t), z(t)$ vs. time.\n",
    "- **Divergence of nearby trajectories** and your estimate of the Lyapunov exponent,  \n",
    "- **Poincaré map** using an appropriate section.\n",
    "\n",
    "All figures must be clearly labelled and physically described and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarise the main insights, addressing the objectives stated in the Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the analytical structure of the system,  \n",
    "- what triggers chaotic behaviour,  \n",
    "- how your numerical solver performed,  \n",
    "- what the simulations reveal about nonlinear dynamics in the chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep conclusions short and to the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "\n",
    "Include all papers, books, and online material used (including the references provided in the assignment). Use a standard bibliography style.\n"
