    "## Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to write **OOP-based Python code** and demonstrate the behaviour of your chosen 3D system (including chaotic regimes) **inside a single Jupyter notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed points and Bifurcations:** Analyse the fixed points and discuss possible bifurcations, and identify the **key parameter(s)** that control the transition to chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code development using Python classes**: Create a Python class for your dynamical system. The class name must reflect your system (e.g. `RosslerSystem`, `ChuaSystem`, etc.). Your class must include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **constructor** containing all model parameters (with reasonable default values).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A method defining the **ODE slope** (the time derivatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **Integrator** method with at least **two** algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - one **should be your own** (e.g. RK3),\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - one from **SciPy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Metric** method to study divergence of nearby trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Run** method to perform simulations and return the orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **Output** method to write trajectories in **VTP format** (for ParaView or VisIt).\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Simulation and Analysis**: Now you will use your class to explore parameter space. Show a few selected runs to illustrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- non-chaotic vs chaotic behaviour,\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3D phase-space trajectories and **phase portraits**,\n",
    "\n",
    "- the evolution of $x(t), y(t), z(t)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "- divergence of nearby trajectories, including the Lyapunov exponent estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **bifurcation diagram** for at least one relevant parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **Poincaré map** (Lorenz-like) using an appropriate section.\n",
    "\n",
    "All results must be presented clearly in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission and Oral Presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please submit your notebook **on Sunday 13 December 2025** using the link provided via email.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will also be required to present your notebook and results **in a short and concise 5-minute presentation** on the same day. \n"
